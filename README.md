# sqlalchemy-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to connect to a sqlite database and produce information about the precipitation values in hawaii. 

The data was used to produce a line graph of precipitation values over a one year period as well as determine which stations reported the most. The station that reported the most was 'USC00519281' also known as 'WAIHEE 837.5, HI US' 

After using sqlalchemy, the next part of the assignment was to create a flask api to route to all the work i had done above. I am not entirely sure that I have done it correctly. But if this isnt right, I dont know what is. 

Overall I think I have done everything that is asked of the assignment.
